These are the Protocol Buffer definitions for Teletype.  They define the highly-compressed LPWAN "on-air" data format transmitted between the teletype client devices and the gateways.

I use two language bindings: golang for the gateway and service, and clang for the device.

I use google's protocol buffers tools for the gateway and service, and "nanopb" for the device.
